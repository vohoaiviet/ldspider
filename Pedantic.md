  * 301 redirect at http://www.fao.org/aims/aos/fi/water_EEZ_v1_0.owl (permanent redirect, cachable, should change original uri.
  * 302 redirect on http://www.purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/author and http://semanticweb.org/id/Karlsruhe_Institute_of_Technology - is that linked data conform?
> RFC2616 "This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field." which would be ok I guess.
  * 303 not cached "The 303 response MUST NOT be cached" -> RFC2616 10.3.4
